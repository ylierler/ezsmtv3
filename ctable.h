// /*============================================================
//
// This is the header for using the "incremental" cmodels
//  A typical flow is
//
// 1. calling read(FILE *f) where f is the file containing
//    grounded program (by Lparse or Gringo)
//    Will load grounded program into Cmodels
//    if retunred value of read is different from 0
//    then there is an error in input
//
// 2. calling setSolver(SolverType st) 
//    SolverType is defined in defines.h
//    for incremental solving valid types are MINISAT and ZCHAFF and MINISAT1
//    feedback solving is available only with MINISAT1
//    By default it will be MINISAT
// 2.1 calling void setExecutionArgs(char *args)
//    passes on string of possible arguments that are then used in solving
//    e.g. --forget=50 forget 50% learnt clauses at each denial added externally
//
// 3.  Calling  Initialize(int* answerset_lits, int& num_atoms) 
//    that allows Cmodels to perform all the necessery preprocessing on the progarm
//    including initiate SAT_manager.
//    The memory for answerset_lits should be allocated before calling Solve.
//    The length of an array should be the number of atoms in the grounded 
//     program located in FILE* f passed to read.
//    (int getNumberGroundedAtoms() returns this number.)
//    Cmodels might establish that there is no or that there 
//    is a unique answer set at the time of preproccessing.
//    After the execution of Initialize, if num_atoms is a positive integer then 
//    the unique answer set was found by preprocessing step and it is returned in 
//    answerset_lits array contains an array of integers 
//    where each integer stands for 
//    the id (assigned by lparse or gringo) for every atom that belongs to 
//    the answer set found by Cmodels.
//    If no answer set is found then num_atoms is assigned -1.
//    If neither answer set if found nor it is eastablished that 
//    there is a unique answer set then -2 is returned.

//
// 4. Calling   void Solve(int* answerset_lits, int& num_atoms, char ** answerset_lits_names);
//   int* answerset_lits:
//     The memory for answerset_lits should be allocated before calling Solve.
//    The length of an array should be the number of atoms in the grounded   
//     program located in FILE* f passed to read.
//    (int getNumberGroundedAtoms() returns this number.)
//    After the execution of Solve answerset_lits contains an array of integers 
//    where each integer stands for 
//    the id (assigned by lparse or gringo) for every atom that belongs to 
//    the answer set found by Cmodels.
// char ** answerset_lits_names:
//    by default is NULL
//    if the memory to answerset_lits_names is allocated in the following manner:
//    The length of an array should be the number of atoms as in answerset_lits array case
//        and each char* should be of at least length 1024 (deafult number of characters for 
//        atom_name)
//    then the array will contain names of atoms that belong to found answer set (i.e.
//    names of atoms that correspond to ids in int* answerset_lits.
// int& num_atoms:
//    If no answer set is found then num_atoms is assigned -1.
//    If answer set if found then num_atoms contains the number of atoms in returned array.
//    If answer set solver were not able to establish anything (UNKNOWN) then num_atoms =-2 

// 5. Add denial (constraint, i.e., :-a,b, not c) by calling 
//    addDenial (int* constaint_lits, int num_lits) 
//    Constraint is represented by an array of integers. 
//      
//    For instance, for constraint :-a,b, not c, such that
//    Lparse or (Gringo) assigned ID's 1 to a, 2 to b, and 3 to c
//    
//    Each literal in constraint, e.g., a..c is represented  by
//    2 * Lparse_id + Sign. The Sign is 0 for positive literals,
//    and 1 for literals under negation as failure. 
//    So in the example above constraint :-a,b, not c (:- 1,2, not 3)
//    should be represneted by (2,4,7)
//    The assumption is that literals are given in sorted ascending order
//    addDenial returns false if it was established that the denial makes the problem
//    inconsistent; otherwise it returns true (i.e., nothing is established and denial is added)
//    Note: 
//    if a variable occures in both positively and negatively, 
//    the constrainet is dropped.

// 6. Mark atoms that are constrained externally so that additional propagation rule is set up
//    (i.e. CSP constraints as far as EZCSP is concerned)
//    constained_atoms -- contains a list of atoms that external solver would like to see values of
//    trueExternal -- suggests which of the constained_atoms are really external atoms 
//    e.g., trueExternal[1]== true says that  constained_atoms[1] is an external atom
//    e.g., trueExternal[2]== false says that  constained_atoms[2] is an asp atom 
//    that external solver wants to see a value of (no external propagators are associated with it
//    num_atoms is an int saying how many members are in constained_atoms (and hence trueExternal)
//    void markExternallyConstrainedAtoms (int* constained_atoms, int num_atoms, bool* trueExternal);
//    Should be performed after Initialize  

//    constained_atoms are represented  by an array of integers. 

//    For instance, for atoms a b c
//    Lparse or (Gringo) assigned ID's 1 to a, 2 to b, and 3 to c
//    then constained_atoms will be an array [1,2,3] and num_atoms will be 3
//    The assumption is that atoms are given in sorted ascending order
//    This functionality is only available with Minisat1 -ms1 option so
//    Warning will be issued and solver flag will be changed to Minisat1 automatically
